# Static_Sound
This code creates 10 seconds of white noise (static noise) using PyDub's WhiteNoise generator and exports it as a WAV audio file named "static_noise.wav." You can adjust the duration as needed.  To play the generated static noise, you can use an appropriate audio player or audio library.
